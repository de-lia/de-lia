Still an kindergartner, trying to develop tech skills, so please go easy on me😪. I do only dumb shit and I'm not smart, I just wear lenses to cover these ugly eye bags.

And baby, let me tell you:

> The Key to a successful relationship is to clear your Internet History.

Yeah, yeah. I stole the quote too.

## Anyways, here's about me:
* 💻 I'm mid-way with responsive web design, sneaking into machine learning without getting caught, and admiring UI/UX from a distance. I know I'll be a darling at every of these.😁
*********************
* ꟺ I'm a Wattpad author. Still upcoming tho.
*********************
* I love being home all day, and what makes me most happy is checking everything on my to-do lists.
*********************
* ♪ And I love my Alan Walker playlist.💆

## Spider Skills:
* C/C++

That's all the lame stuff I can do for now.

## Fun Fact
The Firefox logo isn't a fox… it's a red panda!😄
